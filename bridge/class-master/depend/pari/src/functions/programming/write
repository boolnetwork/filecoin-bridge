Function: write
Section: programming/specific
C-Name: write0
Prototype: vss*
Help: write(filename,{str}*): appends the remaining arguments (same output as
 print) to filename.
Doc: writes (appends) to \var{filename} the remaining arguments, and appends a
 newline (same output as \kbd{print}).

 \misctitle{Variant} The high-level function \kbd{write} is expensive when many
 consecutive writes are expected because it cannot use buffering. The low-level
 interface \kbd{fileopen} / \kbd{filewrite} / \kbd{fileclose} is more efficient.
