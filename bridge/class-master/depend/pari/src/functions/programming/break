Function: break
Section: programming/control
C-Name: break0
Prototype: D1,L,
Help: break({n=1}): interrupt execution of current instruction sequence, and
 exit from the n innermost enclosing loops.
Doc: interrupts execution of current \var{seq}, and
 immediately exits from the $n$ innermost enclosing loops, within the
 current function call (or the top level loop); the integer $n$ must be
 positive. If $n$ is greater than the number of enclosing loops, all
 enclosing loops are exited.
