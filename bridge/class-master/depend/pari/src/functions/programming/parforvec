Function: parforvec
Section: programming/parallel
C-Name: parforvec0
Prototype: vV=GJDVDID0,L,
Description:
 (gen,closure,,,?small):void parforvec($1, $2, $5, NULL, NULL)
Help: parforvec(X=v,expr1,{j},{expr2},{flag}): evaluates the sequence expr2
 (dependent on X and j) for X as generated by forvec, in random order,
 computed in parallel. Substitute for j the value of expr1 (dependent on X).
Doc: evaluates the sequence \kbd{expr2} (dependent on $X$ and $j$) for $X$
 as generated by \kbd{forvec}, in random order, computed in parallel. Substitute
 for $j$ the value of \kbd{expr1} (dependent on $X$).

 It is allowed fo \kbd{expr2} to exit the loop using
 \kbd{break}/\kbd{next}/\kbd{return}, however in that case, \kbd{expr2} will
 still be evaluated for all remaining value of $p$ less than the current one,
 unless a subsequent \kbd{break}/\kbd{next}/\kbd{return} happens.
