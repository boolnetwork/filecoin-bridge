Function: type
Section: programming/specific
C-Name: type0
Prototype: G
Help: type(x): return the type of the GEN x.
Description:
 (gen):typ              typ($1)
Doc: this is useful only under \kbd{gp}. Returns the internal type name of
 the PARI object $x$ as a  string. Check out existing type names with the
 metacommand \b{t}. For example \kbd{type(1)} will return "\typ{INT}".
Variant: The macro \kbd{typ} is usually simpler to use since it returns a
 \kbd{long} that can easily be matched with the symbols \typ{*}. The name
 \kbd{type} was avoided since it is a reserved identifier for some compilers.
