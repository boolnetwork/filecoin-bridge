Function: forstep
Section: programming/control
C-Name: forstep
Prototype: vV=GGGI
Help: forstep(X=a,b,s,seq): the sequence is evaluated, X going from a to b
 in steps of s (can be a vector of steps). If b is set to +oo the loop will
 not stop.
Doc: evaluates \var{seq}, where the formal variable $X$ goes from $a$ to $b$
 in increments of $s$. Nothing is done if $s>0$ and $a>b$ or if $s<0$
 and $a<b$. $s$ must be in $\R^*$ or an intmod \kbd{Mod(c,N)} (restrict to
 the corresponding arithmetic progression) or a vector of steps
 $[s_1,\dots,s_n]$ (the successive steps in $\R^*$ are used in the order they
 appear in $s$).

 @eprog\noindent Setting $b$ to \kbd{+oo} will start an infinite loop; it is
 expected that the caller will break out of the loop itself at some point,
 using \kbd{break} or \kbd{return}.
