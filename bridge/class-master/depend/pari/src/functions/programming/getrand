Help: getrand(): current value of random number seed.
Doc: returns the current value of the seed used by the
 pseudo-random number generator \tet{random}. Useful mainly for debugging
 purposes, to reproduce a specific chain of computations. The returned value
 is technical (reproduces an internal state array), and can only be used as an
 argument to \tet{setrand}.
