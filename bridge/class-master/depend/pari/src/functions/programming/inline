Help: inline(x,...,z): declares x,...,z as inline variables [EXPERIMENTAL].
Doc: (Experimental) declare $x,\ldots, z$ as inline variables. Such variables
 behave like lexically scoped variable (see my()) but with unlimited scope.
 It is however possible to exit the scope by using \kbd{uninline()}.
 When used in a GP script, it is recommended to call \kbd{uninline()} before
 the script's end to avoid inline variables leaking outside the script.
