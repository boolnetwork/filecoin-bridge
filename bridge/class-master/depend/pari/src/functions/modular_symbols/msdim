Function: msdim
Section: modular_symbols
C-Name: msdim
Prototype: lG
Help: msdim(M): M being a modular symbol space or subspace,
 return its dimension as a Q-vector space.
Doc: $M$ being a full modular symbol space or subspace, for instance
 as given by \kbd{msinit} or \kbd{mscuspidal}, return
 its dimension as a $\Q$-vector space.
 \bprog
 ? M = msinit(11,4); msdim(M)
 %1 = 6
 ? M = msinit(11,4,1); msdim(M)
 %2 = 4 \\ dimension of the '+' part
 ? [S,E] = mscuspidal(M,1);
 ? [msdim(S), msdim(E)]
 %4 = [2, 2]
 @eprog\noindent Note that \kbd{mfdim([N,k])} is going to be much faster if
 you only need the dimension of the space and not really to work with it.
 This function is only useful to quickly check the dimension of an existing
 space.
