Function: matkerint
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: matkerint0
Prototype: GD0,L,
Help: matkerint(x,{flag=0}): LLL-reduced Z-basis of the kernel of the matrix
 x with integral entries. flag is deprecated, and may be set to 0 or 1
 for backward compatibility.
Doc: gives an \idx{LLL}-reduced $\Z$-basis
 for the lattice equal to the kernel of the matrix $x$ with rational entries.

 \fl is deprecated, kept for backward compatibility.

Variant: Use directly \fun{GEN}{kerint}{GEN x} if $x$ is known to have
 integer entries, and \tet{Q_primpart} first otherwise.
