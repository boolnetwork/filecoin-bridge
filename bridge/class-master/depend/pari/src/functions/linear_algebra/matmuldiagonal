Function: matmuldiagonal
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: matmuldiagonal
Prototype: GG
Help: matmuldiagonal(x,d): product of matrix x by diagonal matrix whose
 diagonal coefficients are those of the vector d, equivalent but faster than
 x*matdiagonal(d).
Doc: product of the matrix $x$ by the diagonal
 matrix whose diagonal entries are those of the vector $d$. Equivalent to,
 but much faster than $x*\kbd{matdiagonal}(d)$.
