Function: forqfvec
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: forqfvec0
Prototype: vVGDGI
Help:forqfvec(v,q,b,expr): q being a square and symmetric integral matrix
 representing an positive definite quadratic form, evaluate expr
 for all vectors v such that q(v)<=b.
Doc: $q$ being a square and symmetric integral matrix representing a positive
 definite
 quadratic form, evaluate \kbd{expr} for all vector $v$ such that $q(v)\leq b$.
 The formal variable $v$ runs through all such vectors in turn.

Variant: The following function is also available:
 \fun{void}{forqfvec}{void *E, long (*fun)(void *, GEN, GEN, double), GEN q, GEN b}:
 Evaluate \kbd{fun(E,w,v,m)} on all $v$ such that $q(v)<b$, where $v$ is a
 \typ{VECSMALL} and $m=q(v)$ is a C double. The function \kbd{fun} must
 return $0$, unless \kbd{forqfvec} should stop, in which case, it should
 return $1$.
