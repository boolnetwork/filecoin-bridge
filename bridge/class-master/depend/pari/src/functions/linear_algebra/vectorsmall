Function: vectorsmall
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: vecteursmall
Prototype: GDVDE
Help: vectorsmall(n,{X},{expr=0}): VECSMALL with n components of expression
 expr (X ranges from 1 to n) which must be small integers. By default, fill
 with 0s.
Doc: creates a row vector of small integers (type
 \typ{VECSMALL}) with $n$ components whose components are the expression
 \var{expr} evaluated at the integer points between 1 and $n$. If one of the
 last two arguments is omitted, fill the vector with zeroes.
