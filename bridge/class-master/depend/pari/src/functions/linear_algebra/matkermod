Function: matkermod

C-Name: matkermod
Prototype: GGD&
Help: matkermod(x,d,&im): basis of the kernel of the matrix x modulo d.
Doc: gives a Howell basis (unique representation for submodules of~$(\Z/d\Z)^n$,
 cf. \kbd{matimagemod}) for the kernel of the matrix $x$ modulo $d$ as columns
 of a matrix. The matrix $x$ must have \typ{INT} entries, and $d$ can be an
 arbitrary positive integer. If $im$ is present, set it to a basis of the image
 of~$x$ (which is computed on the way).
