Function: matimagecompl
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: imagecompl
Prototype: G
Description:
 (gen):vecsmall                imagecompl($1)
Help: matimagecompl(x): vector of column indices not corresponding to the
 indices given by the function matimage.
Doc: gives the vector of the column indices which
 are not extracted by the function \kbd{matimage}, as a permutation
 (\typ{VECSMALL}). Hence the number of
 components of \kbd{matimagecompl(x)} plus the number of columns of
 \kbd{matimage(x)} is equal to the number of columns of the matrix $x$.
