Function: qfauto
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: qfauto0
Prototype: GDG
Help: qfauto(G,{fl}): automorphism group of the positive definite quadratic
 form G.
Doc:
 $G$ being a square and symmetric matrix with integer entries representing a
 positive definite quadratic form, outputs the automorphism group of the
 associate lattice.
 Since this requires computing the minimal vectors, the computations can
 become very lengthy as the dimension grows. $G$ can also be given by an
 \kbd{qfisominit} structure.
 See \kbd{qfisominit} for the meaning of \var{fl}.

 The output is a two-components vector $[o,g]$ where $o$ is the group order
 and $g$ is the list of generators (as a vector). For each generator $H$,
 the equality $G={^t}H\*G\*H$ holds.

 The interface of this function is experimental and will likely change in the
 future.

 This function implements an algorithm of Plesken and Souvignier, following
 Souvignier's implementation.

Variant: The function \fun{GEN}{qfauto}{GEN G, GEN fl} is also available
 where $G$ is a vector of \kbd{zm} matrices.
