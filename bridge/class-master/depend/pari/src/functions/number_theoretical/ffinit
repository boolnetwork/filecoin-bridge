Function: ffinit
Section: number_theoretical
C-Name: ffinit
Prototype: GLDn
Help: ffinit(p,n,{v='x}): monic irreducible polynomial of degree n over F_p[v].
Description:
 (int, small, ?var):pol        ffinit($1, $2, $3)
Doc: computes a monic polynomial of degree $n$ which is irreducible over
  $\F_p$, where $p$ is assumed to be prime. This function uses a fast variant
  of Adleman and Lenstra's algorithm.

 It is useful in conjunction with \tet{ffgen}; for instance if
 \kbd{P = ffinit(3,2)}, you can represent elements in $\F_{3^2}$ in term of
 \kbd{g = ffgen(P,'t)}. This can be abbreviated as
 \kbd{g = ffgen(3\pow2, 't)}, where the defining polynomial $P$ can be later
 recovered as \kbd{g.mod}.
