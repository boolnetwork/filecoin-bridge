Help: qfbcompraw(x,y): Gaussian composition without reduction of the binary
 quadratic forms x and y.
Doc: \idx{composition} of the binary quadratic forms $x$ and $y$, without
 \idx{reduction} of the result. This is useful e.g.~to compute a generating
 element of an ideal. The result is undefined if $x$ and $y$ do not have the
 same discriminant.
