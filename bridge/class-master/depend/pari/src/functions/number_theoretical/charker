Help: charker(cyc,chi): given a finite abelian group (by its elementary
 divisors cyc) and a character chi, return its kernel.
Doc: let \var{cyc} represent a finite abelian group by its elementary
 divisors, i.e. $(d_j)$ represents $\sum_{j \leq k} \Z/d_j\Z$ with $d_k
 \mid \dots \mid d_1$; any object which has a \kbd{.cyc} method is also
 allowed, e.g.~the output of \kbd{znstar} or \kbd{bnrinit}. A character
 on this group is given by a row vector $\chi = [a_1,\ldots,a_n]$ such that
 $\chi(\prod g_j^{n_j}) = \exp(2\pi i\sum a_j n_j / d_j)$, where $g_j$ denotes
 the generator (of order $d_j$) of the $j$-th cyclic component.

 This function returns the kernel of $\chi$, as a matrix $K$ in HNF which is a
 left-divisor of \kbd{matdiagonal(d)}. Its columns express in terms of
 the $g_j$ the generators of the subgroup. The determinant of $K$ is the
 kernel index.

 @eprog\noindent Note that for Dirichlet characters (when \kbd{cyc} is
 \kbd{znstar(q, 1)}), characters in Conrey representation are available,
 see \secref{se:dirichletchar} or \kbd{??character}.

Variant: Also available is
 \fun{GEN}{charker}{GEN cyc, GEN chi}, when \kbd{cyc} is known to
 be a vector of elementary divisors and \kbd{chi} a compatible character
 (no checks).
