C-Name: lfuntwist
Prototype: GG
Help: lfuntwist(L,chi): creates the Ldata structure (without
 initialization) corresponding to the twist of L by the primitive character
 attached to the Dirichlet L-function chi. This requires that the conductor
 of the character is coprime to the conductor of the L-function L.
Doc: creates the Ldata structure (without initialization) corresponding to the
 twist of L by the primitive character attached to the Dirichlet character
 \kbd{chi}.  The conductor of the character must be coprime to the conductor
 of the L-function $L$.
