C-Name: lfungenus2
Prototype: G
Help: lfungenus2(F): returns the Ldata structure attached to the
 L-function attached to the genus-2 curve defined by y^2=F(x)
 or y^2+Q(x)*y=P(x) if F=[P,Q].
 Currently, only odd conductors are supported, and the model needs to
 be minimal at 2.
Doc: returns the \kbd{Ldata} structure attached to the $L$ function
 attached to the genus-2 curve defined by $y^2=F(x)$ or
 $y^2+Q(x)\*y=P(x)$ if $F=[P,Q]$.
 Currently, the model needs to be minimal at 2, and if the conductor
 is even, its valuation at $2$ might be incorrect (a warning is issued).
