C-Name: lfunetaquo
Prototype: G
Help: lfunetaquo(M): returns the Ldata structure attached to the
 modular form z->prod(i=1,#M[,1],eta(M[i,1]*z)^M[i,2]).
Doc: returns the \kbd{Ldata} structure attached to the $L$ function
 attached to the modular form
 $z\mapsto \prod_{i=1}^n \eta(M_{i,1}\*z)^{M_{i,2}}$
 It is currently assumed that $f$ is a self-dual cuspidal form on
 $\Gamma_0(N)$ for some $N$.
 For instance, the $L$-function $\sum \tau(n) n^{-s}$
 attached to Ramanujan's $\Delta$ function is encoded as follows
 \bprog
 ? L = lfunetaquo(Mat([1,24]));
 ? lfunan(L, 100)  \\ first 100 values of tau(n)
 @eprog\noindent For convenience, a \typ{VEC} is also accepted instead of
 a factorization matrix with a single row:
 \bprog
 ? L = lfunetaquo([1,24]); \\ same as above
 @eprog
