Function: besseljh
Section: transcendental
C-Name: jbesselh
Prototype: GGp
Help: besseljh(n,x): J-bessel function of index n+1/2 and argument x, where
 n is a non-negative integer.
Doc: $J$-Bessel function of half integral index.
 More precisely, $\kbd{besseljh}(n,x)$ computes $J_{n+1/2}(x)$ where $n$
 must be of type integer, and $x$ is any element of $\C$. In the
 present version \vers, this function is not very accurate when $x$ is small.
