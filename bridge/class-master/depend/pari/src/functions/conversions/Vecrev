Function: Vecrev
Section: conversions
C-Name: gtovecrev0
Prototype: GD0,L,
Help: Vecrev(x, {n}): transforms the object x into a vector of dimension n
 in reverse order with respect to Vec(x, {n}).
Description:
 (gen):vec     gtovecrev($1)
Doc:
 as $\kbd{Vec}(x, -n)$, then reverse the result. In particular,
 \kbd{Vecrev} is the reciprocal function of \kbd{Polrev}: the
 coefficients of the vector start with the constant coefficient of the
 polynomial and the others follow by increasing degree.
Variant: \fun{GEN}{gtovecrev}{GEN x} is also available.
