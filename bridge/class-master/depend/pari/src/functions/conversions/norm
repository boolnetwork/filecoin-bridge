 algebraic norm of $x$, i.e.~the product of $x$ with
 its conjugate (no square roots are taken), or conjugates for polmods. For
 vectors and matrices, the norm is taken componentwise and hence is not the
 $L^2$-norm (see \kbd{norml2}). Note that the norm of an element of
 $\R$ is its square, so as to be compatible with the complex norm.
