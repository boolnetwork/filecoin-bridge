Function: List
Section: conversions
C-Name: gtolist
Prototype: DG
Help: List({x=[]}): transforms the vector or list x into a list. Empty list
 if x is omitted.
Description:
 ():list           mklist()
 (gen):list        listinit(gtolist($1))
Doc:
 transforms a (row or column) vector $x$ into a list, whose components are
 the entries of $x$. Similarly for a list, but rather useless in this case.
 For other types, creates a list with the single element $x$. Note that,
 except when $x$ is omitted, this function creates a small memory leak; so,
 either initialize all lists to the empty list, or use them sparingly.
Variant: The variant \fun{GEN}{mklist}{void} creates an empty list.
