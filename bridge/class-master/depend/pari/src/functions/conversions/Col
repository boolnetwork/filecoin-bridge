C-Name: gtocol0
Prototype: GD0,L,
Help: Col(x, {n}): transforms the object x into a column vector of dimension n.
Description:
 (gen):vec     gtocol($1)
Doc:
 transforms the object $x$ into a column vector. The dimension of the
 resulting vector can be optionally specified via the extra parameter $n$.

 If $n$ is omitted or $0$, the dimension depends on the type of $x$; the
 vector has a single component, except when $x$ is

 \item a vector or a quadratic form (in which case the resulting vector
 is simply the initial object considered as a row vector),

 \item a polynomial or a power series. In the case of a polynomial, the
 coefficients of the vector start with the leading coefficient of the
 polynomial, while for power series only the significant coefficients are
 taken into account, but this time by increasing order of degree.
 In this last case, \kbd{Vec} is the reciprocal function of \kbd{Pol} and
 \kbd{Ser} respectively,

 \item a matrix (the column of row vector comprising the matrix is returned),

 \item a character string (a vector of individual characters is returned).

 In the last two cases (matrix and character string), $n$ is meaningless and
 must be omitted or an error is raised. Otherwise, if $n$ is given, $0$
 entries are appended at the end of the vector if $n > 0$, and prepended at
 the beginning if $n < 0$. The dimension of the resulting vector is $|n|$.

 See ??Vec for examples.

Variant: \fun{GEN}{gtocol}{GEN x} is also available.
