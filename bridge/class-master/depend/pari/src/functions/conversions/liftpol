Function: liftpol
Section: conversions
C-Name: liftpol
Prototype: G
Help: liftpol(x): lifts every polmod component of x to polynomials.
Description:
 (pol):pol        liftpol($1)
 (vec):vec        liftpol($1)
 (gen):gen        liftpol($1)
Doc: recursively lift all components of $x$ which are polmods to
 polynomials. \typ{FFELT} are not lifted, nor are List elements: you may
 convert the latter to vectors first, or use \kbd{apply(liftpol,L)}. More
 generally, components for which such lifts are meaningless (e.g. character
 strings) are copied verbatim.
 \bprog
 ? liftpol(x * (1 + O(3)) + Mod(2,3))
 %1 = (1 + O(3))*x + Mod(2, 3)
 ? liftpol(x * Mod(y,y^2+1) + Mod(2,3)*Mod(z,z^2))
 %2 = y*x + Mod(2, 3)*z
