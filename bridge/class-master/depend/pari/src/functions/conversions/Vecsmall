Function: Vecsmall
Section: conversions
C-Name: gtovecsmall0
Prototype: GD0,L,
Help: Vecsmall(x, {n}): transforms the object x into a VECSMALL of dimension n.
Description:
 (gen):vecsmall                gtovecsmall($1)
Doc:
 transforms the object $x$ into a row vector of type \typ{VECSMALL}. The
 dimension of the resulting vector can be optionally specified via the extra
 parameter $n$.

 This acts as \kbd{Vec}$(x,n)$, but only on a limited set of objects:
 the result must be representable as a vector of small integers.
 If $x$ is a character string, a vector of individual characters in ASCII
 encoding is returned (\tet{Strchr} yields back the character string).
Variant: \fun{GEN}{gtovecsmall}{GEN x} is also available.
