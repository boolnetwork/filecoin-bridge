Function: bitor
Section: conversions
C-Name: gbitor
Prototype: GG
Help: bitor(x,y): bitwise "or" of two integers x and y. Negative numbers
 behave as if modulo big power of 2.
Description:
 (small, small):small:parens        $(1)|$(2)
 (gen, gen):int        gbitor($1, $2)
Doc:
 \sidx{bitwise inclusive or}bitwise (inclusive)
 \tet{or} of two integers $x$ and $y$, that is the integer $$\sum
 (x_i~\kbd{or}~y_i) 2^i$$

 See \secref{se:bitand} for the behavior for negative arguments.
Variant: Also available is
 \fun{GEN}{ibitor}{GEN x, GEN y}, which returns the bitwise \emph{ir}
 of $|x|$ and $|y|$, two integers.
