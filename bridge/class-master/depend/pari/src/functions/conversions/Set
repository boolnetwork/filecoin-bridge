C-Name: gtoset
Prototype: DG
Help: Set({x=[]}): convert x into a set, i.e. a row vector with strictly
 increasing coefficients. Empty set if x is omitted.
Description:
 ():vec           cgetg(1,t_VEC)
 (gen):vec        gtoset($1)
Doc:
 converts $x$ into a set, i.e.~into a row vector, with strictly increasing
 entries with respect to the (somewhat arbitrary) universal comparison function
 \tet{cmp}. Standard container types \typ{VEC}, \typ{COL}, \typ{LIST} and
 \typ{VECSMALL} are converted to the set with corresponding elements. All
 others are converted to a set with one element.
 \bprog
 ? Set([1,2,4,2,1,3])
 %1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
 ? Set(x)
 %2 = [x]
 ? Set(Vecsmall([1,3,2,1,3]))
 %3 = [1, 2, 3]
