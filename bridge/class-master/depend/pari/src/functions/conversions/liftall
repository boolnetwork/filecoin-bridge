Function: liftall
Section: conversions
C-Name: liftall
Prototype: G
Help: liftall(x): lifts every element of Z/nZ to Z, of Qp to Q, and of
 K[x]/(P) to K[x].
Description:
 (pol):pol        liftall($1)
 (vec):vec        liftall($1)
 (gen):gen        liftall($1)
Doc:
 recursively lift all components of $x$ from $\Z/n\Z$ to $\Z$,
 from $\Q_p$ to $\Q$ (as \tet{truncate}), and polmods to
 polynomials. \typ{FFELT} are not lifted, nor are List elements: you may
 convert the latter to vectors first, or use \kbd{apply(liftall,L)}. More
 generally, components for which such lifts are meaningless (e.g. character
 strings) are copied verbatim.
 \bprog
 ? liftall(x * (1 + O(3)) + Mod(2,3))
 %1 = x + 2
 ? liftall(x * Mod(y,y^2+1) + Mod(2,3)*Mod(z,z^2))
 %2 = y*x + 2*z
