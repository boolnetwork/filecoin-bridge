Function: galoispermtopol

C-Name: galoispermtopol
Prototype: GG
Help: galoispermtopol(gal,perm): gal being a Galois group as output by
 galoisinit and perm a element of gal.group, return the polynomial defining
 the corresponding Galois automorphism.
Doc: \var{gal} being a
 Galois group as output by \kbd{galoisinit} and \var{perm} a element of
 $\var{gal}.group$, return the polynomial defining the Galois
 automorphism, as output by \kbd{nfgaloisconj}, attached to the
 permutation \var{perm} of the roots $\var{gal}.roots$. \var{perm} can
 also be a vector or matrix, in this case, \kbd{galoispermtopol} is
 applied to all components recursively.

 \noindent Note that
 \bprog
 G = galoisinit(pol);
 galoispermtopol(G, G[6])~
 @eprog\noindent
 is equivalent to \kbd{nfgaloisconj(pol)}, if degree of \var{pol} is greater
 or equal to $2$.
