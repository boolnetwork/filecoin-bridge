Function: bnfisintnorm
Section: number_fields
C-Name: bnfisintnorm
Prototype: GG
Help: bnfisintnorm(bnf,x): compute a complete system of solutions (modulo
 units of positive norm) of the absolute norm equation N(a)=x, where a
 belongs to the maximal order of big number field bnf (if bnf is not
 certified, this depends on GRH).
Doc: computes a complete system of
 solutions (modulo units of positive norm) of the absolute norm equation
 $\Norm(a)=x$,
 where $a$ is an integer in $\var{bnf}$. If $\var{bnf}$ has not been certified,
 the correctness of the result depends on the validity of \idx{GRH}.

 See also \tet{bnfisnorm}.
Variant: The function \fun{GEN}{bnfisintnormabs}{GEN bnf, GEN a}
 returns a complete system of solutions modulo units of the absolute norm
 equation $|\Norm(x)| = |a|$. As fast as \kbd{bnfisintnorm}, but solves
 the two equations $\Norm(x) = \pm a$ simultaneously.
