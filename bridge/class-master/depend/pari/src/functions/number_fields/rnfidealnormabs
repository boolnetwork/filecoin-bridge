Help: rnfidealnormabs(rnf,x): absolute norm of the ideal x.
Doc: let $\var{rnf}$ be a relative
 number field extension $L/K$ as output by \kbd{rnfinit} and let $x$ be a
 relative ideal (which can be, as in the absolute case, of many different
 types, including of course elements). This function computes the norm of the
 $x$ considered as an ideal of the absolute extension $L/\Q$. This is
 identical to
 \bprog
    idealnorm(rnf, rnfidealnormrel(rnf,x))
 @eprog\noindent but faster.
