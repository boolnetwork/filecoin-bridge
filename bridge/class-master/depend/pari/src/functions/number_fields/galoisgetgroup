Description:
 (small):int               galoisnbpol($1)
 (small,):int              galoisnbpol($1)
 (small,small):vec         galoisgetgroup($1, $2)
Help: galoisgetgroup(a,{b}): query the galpol package for a group of order a
 with index b in the GAP4 Small Group library. If b is omitted, return the
 number of isomorphism classes of groups of order a.
Doc: Query the \kbd{galpol} package for a group of order $a$ with index $b$
 in the GAP4 Small Group library, by Hans Ulrich Besche, Bettina Eick and
 Eamonn O'Brien.

 The current version of \kbd{galpol} supports groups of order $a\leq 143$.
 If $b$ is omitted, return the number of isomorphism classes of
 groups of order $a$.
Variant: Also available is \fun{GEN}{galoisnbpol}{long a} when $b$
 is omitted.
