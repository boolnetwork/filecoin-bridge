Function: rnfpolred
Section: number_fields
C-Name: rnfpolred
Prototype: GGp
Obsolete: 2013-12-28
Help: rnfpolred(nf,pol): given a pol with coefficients in nf, finds a list
 of relative polynomials defining some subfields, hopefully simpler.
Doc:  This function is obsolete: use \tet{rnfpolredbest} instead.
 Relative version of \kbd{polred}. Given a monic polynomial \var{pol} with
 coefficients in $\var{nf}$, finds a list of relative polynomials defining some
 subfields, hopefully simpler and containing the original field. In the present
 version \vers, this is slower and less efficient than \kbd{rnfpolredbest}.

 \misctitle{Remark} this function is based on an incomplete reduction
 theory of lattices over number fields, implemented by \kbd{rnflllgram}, which
 deserves to be improved.
