C-Name: rnfalgtobasis
Prototype: GG
Help: rnfalgtobasis(rnf,x): relative version of nfalgtobasis, where rnf is a
 relative numberfield.
Doc: expresses $x$ on the relative
 integral basis. Here, $\var{rnf}$ is a relative number field extension $L/K$
 as output by \kbd{rnfinit}, and $x$ an element of $L$ in absolute form, i.e.
 expressed as a polynomial or polmod with polmod coefficients, \emph{not} on
 the relative integral basis.
