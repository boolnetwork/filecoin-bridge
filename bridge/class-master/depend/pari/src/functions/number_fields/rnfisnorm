C-Name: rnfisnorm
Prototype: GGD0,L,
Help: rnfisnorm(T,a,{flag=0}): T is as output by rnfisnorminit applied to
 L/K. Tries to tell whether a is a norm from L/K. Returns a vector [x,q]
 where a=Norm(x)*q. Looks for a solution which is a S-integer, with S a list
 of places in K containing the ramified primes, generators of the class group
 of ext, as well as those primes dividing a. If L/K is Galois, omit flag,
 otherwise it is used to add more places to S: all the places above the
 primes p <= flag (resp. p | flag) if flag > 0 (resp. flag < 0). The answer
 is guaranteed (i.e a is a norm iff q=1) if L/K is Galois or, under GRH, if S
 contains all primes less than 12.log(disc(M))^2, where M is the normal
 closure of L/K.
Doc: similar to
 \kbd{bnfisnorm} but in the relative case. $T$ is as output by
 \tet{rnfisnorminit} applied to the extension $L/K$. This tries to decide
 whether the element $a$ in $K$ is the norm of some $x$ in the extension
 $L/K$.

 The output is a vector $[x,q]$, where $a = \Norm(x)*q$. The
 algorithm looks for a solution $x$ which is an $S$-integer, with $S$ a list
 of places of $K$ containing at least the ramified primes, the generators of
 the class group of $L$, as well as those primes dividing $a$. If $L/K$ is
 Galois, then this is enough; otherwise, $\fl$ is used to add more primes to
 $S$: all the places above the primes $p \leq \fl$ (resp.~$p|\fl$) if $\fl>0$
 (resp.~$\fl<0$).

 The answer is guaranteed (i.e.~$a$ is a norm iff $q = 1$) if the field is
 Galois, or, under \idx{GRH}, if $S$ contains all primes less than
 $12\log^2\left|\disc(M)\right|$, where $M$ is the normal
 closure of $L/K$.

 If \tet{rnfisnorminit} has determined (or was told) that $L/K$ is
 \idx{Galois}, and $\fl \neq 0$, a Warning is issued (so that you can set
 $\fl = 1$ to check whether $L/K$ is known to be Galois, according to $T$).
 Example:

 \bprog
 bnf = bnfinit(y^3 + y^2 - 2*y - 1);
 p = x^2 + Mod(y^2 + 2*y + 1, bnf.pol);
 T = rnfisnorminit(bnf, p);
 rnfisnorm(T, 17)
 @eprog\noindent
 checks whether $17$ is a norm in the Galois extension $\Q(\beta) /
 \Q(\alpha)$, where $\alpha^3 + \alpha^2 - 2\alpha - 1 = 0$ and $\beta^2 +
 \alpha^2 + 2\alpha + 1 = 0$ (it is).
