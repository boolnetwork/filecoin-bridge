Help: newtonpoly(x,p): Newton polygon of polynomial x with respect to the
 prime p.
Doc: gives the vector of the slopes of the Newton
 polygon of the polynomial $x$ with respect to the prime number $p$. The $n$
 components of the vector are in decreasing order, where $n$ is equal to the
 degree of $x$. Vertical slopes occur iff the constant coefficient of $x$ is
 zero and are denoted by \kbd{+oo}.
