Help: idealinv(nf,x): inverse of the ideal x in the number field nf.
Description:
 (gen, gen):gen        idealinv($1, $2)
Doc: inverse of the ideal $x$ in the
 number field $\var{nf}$, given in HNF. If $x$ is an extended
 ideal\sidx{ideal (extended)}, its principal part is suitably
 updated: i.e. inverting $[I,t]$, yields $[I^{-1}, 1/t]$.
