Function: galoisidentify
Section: number_fields
C-Name: galoisidentify
Prototype: G
Help: galoisidentify(gal): gal being a Galois group as output by galoisinit,
 output the isomorphism class of the underlying abstract group as a
 two-components vector [o,i], where o is the group order, and i is the group
 index in the GAP4 small group library.
Doc: \var{gal} being be a Galois group as output by \tet{galoisinit},
 output the isomorphism class of the underlying abstract group as a
 two-components vector $[o,i]$, where $o$ is the group order, and $i$ is the
 group index in the GAP4 Small Group library, by Hans Ulrich Besche, Bettina
 Eick and Eamonn O'Brien.

 This command also accepts subgroups returned by \kbd{galoissubgroups}.

 The current implementation is limited to degree less or equal to $127$.
 Some larger ``easy'' orders are also supported.

 The output is similar to the output of the function \kbd{IdGroup} in GAP4.
 Note that GAP4 \kbd{IdGroup} handles all groups of order less than $2000$
 except $1024$, so you can use \tet{galoisexport} and GAP4 to identify large
 Galois groups.
