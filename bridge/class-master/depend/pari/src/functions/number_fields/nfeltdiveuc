Help: nfeltdiveuc(nf,x,y): gives algebraic integer q such that x-qy is small.
Doc: given two elements $x$ and $y$ in
 \var{nf}, computes an algebraic integer $q$ in the number field $\var{nf}$
 such that the components of $x-qy$ are reasonably small. In fact, this is
 functionally identical to \kbd{round(nfdiv(\var{nf},x,y))}.
