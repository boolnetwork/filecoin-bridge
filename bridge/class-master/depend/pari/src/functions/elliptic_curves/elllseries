Function: elllseries
Section: elliptic_curves
C-Name: elllseries
Prototype: GGDGp
Help: elllseries(E,s,{A=1}): L-series at s of the elliptic curve E, where A
 a cut-off point close to 1.
Obsolete: 2016-08-08
Doc:
 This function is deprecated, use \kbd{lfun(E,s)} instead.

 $E$ being an elliptic curve, given by an arbitrary model over $\Q$ as output
 by \kbd{ellinit}, this function computes the value of the $L$-series of $E$ at
 the (complex) point $s$. This function uses an $O(N^{1/2})$ algorithm, where
 $N$ is the conductor.

 The optional parameter $A$ fixes a cutoff point for the integral and is best
 left omitted; the result must be independent of $A$, up to
 \kbd{realprecision}, so this allows to check the function's accuracy.
