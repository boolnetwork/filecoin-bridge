 index]. It will also convert a triplet back to a curve name.
Doc:
 converts an elliptic curve name, as found in the \tet{elldata} database,
 from a string to a triplet $[\var{conductor}, \var{isogeny class},
 \var{index}]$. It will also convert a triplet back to a curve name.
 Examples:
 \bprog
 ? ellconvertname("123b1")
 %1 = [123, 1, 1]
 ? ellconvertname(%)
 %2 = "123b1"
