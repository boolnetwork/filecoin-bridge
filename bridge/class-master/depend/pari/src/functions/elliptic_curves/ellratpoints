Function: ellratpoints
Section: elliptic_curves
C-Name: ellratpoints
Prototype: GGD0,L,
Help: ellratpoints(E,h,{flag=0}): E being an integral model of an
 elliptic curve, return a vector containing the affine rational points on the curve
 of naive height less than h.
 If fl=1, stop as soon as a point is found.
Doc: $E$ being an integral model of elliptic curve , return a vector
 containing the affine rational points on the curve of naive height less than
 $h$. If $\fl=1$, stop as soon as a point is found; return either an empty
 vector or a vector containing a single point.
 See \kbd{hyperellratpoints} for how $h$ can be specified.
