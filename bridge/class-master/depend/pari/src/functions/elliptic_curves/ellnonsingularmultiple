Function: ellnonsingularmultiple
Section: elliptic_curves
C-Name: ellnonsingularmultiple
Prototype: GG
Help: ellnonsingularmultiple(E,P): given E/Q and P in E(Q), returns the pair
 [R,n] where n is the least positive integer such that R = [n]P has
 everywhere good reduction. More precisely, its image in a minimal model
 is everywhere non-singular.
Doc: given an elliptic curve $E/\Q$ (more precisely, a model defined over $\Q$
 of a curve) and a rational point $P \in E(\Q)$, returns the pair $[R,n]$,
 where $n$ is the least positive integer such that $R := [n]P$ has good
 reduction at every prime. More precisely, its image in a minimal model is
 everywhere non-singular.
