Function: ellan
Section: elliptic_curves
C-Name: ellan
Prototype: GL
Help: ellan(E,n): computes the first n Fourier coefficients of the
 L-function of the elliptic curve E defined over a number field
 (n<2^24 on a 32-bit machine).
Doc: computes the vector of the first $n$ Fourier coefficients $a_k$
 corresponding to the elliptic curve $E$ defined over a number field.
 If $E$ is defined over $\Q$, the curve may be given by an
 arbitrary model, not necessarily minimal,
 although a minimal model will make the function faster. Over a more general
 number field, the model must be locally minimal at all primes above $2$
 and $3$.

Variant: Also available is \fun{GEN}{ellanQ_zv}{GEN e, long n}, which
 returns a \typ{VECSMALL} instead of a \typ{VEC}, saving on memory.
