Help: contfracinit(M,{lim = -1}): given M representing the power
 series S = sum_{n>=0} M[n+1]z^n, transform it into a continued fraction
 suitable for evaluation.
Doc: Given $M$ representing the power series $S=\sum_{n\ge0} M[n+1]z^n$,
 transform it into a continued fraction; restrict to $n\leq \kbd{lim}$
 if latter is non-negative. $M$ can be a vector, a power
 series, a polynomial, or a rational function.
 The result is a 2-component vector $[A,B]$ such that
 $S = M[1] / (1+A[1]z+B[1]z^2/(1+A[2]z+B[2]z^2/(1+...1/(1+A[lim/2]z))))$.
 Does not work if any coefficient of $M$ vanishes, nor for series for
 which certain partial denominators vanish.
