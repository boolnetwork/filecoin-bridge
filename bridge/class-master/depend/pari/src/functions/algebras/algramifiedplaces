Help: algramifiedplaces(al): vector of the places of the center of al that
 ramify in al. Each place is described as an integer between 1 and r1 or as a
 prime ideal.
Doc: Given a central simple algebra \var{al} output by \tet{alginit}, returns a
 \typ{VEC} containing the list of places of the center of \var{al} that are
 ramified in \var{al}. Each place is described as an integer between~$1$
 and~$r_1$ or as a prime ideal.

 ? A = alginit(nf, [-1,y]);
 ? algramifiedplaces(A)
 %3 = [1, [2, [2, 0]~, 1, 2, 1]]
