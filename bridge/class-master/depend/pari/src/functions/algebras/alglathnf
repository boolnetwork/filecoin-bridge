C-Name: alglathnf
Prototype: GGD0,G,
Help: alglathnf(al,m,{d=0}): the lattice generated by the columns of m, assuming
 that this lattice contains d times the integral basis of al.
Doc: Given an algebra \var{al} and a matrix \var{m} with columns representing
 elements of \var{al}, returns the lattice $L$ generated by the columns of
 \var{m}. If provided, \var{d} must be a rational number such that $L$ contains
 \var{d} times the natural basis of~\var{al}. The argument \var{m} is also
 allowed to be a \typ{VEC} of \typ{MAT}, in which case \var{m} is replaced by
 the concatenation of the matrices, or a \typ{COL}, in which case \var{m} is
 replaced by its left multiplication table as an element of \var{al}.
