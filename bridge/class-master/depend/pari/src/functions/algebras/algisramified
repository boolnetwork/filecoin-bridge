Help: algisramified(al,{pl}): tests whether the central simple algebra al is
 ramified, i.e. not isomorphic to a matrix ring over its center. If pl is set,
 it should be a prime ideal of the center or an integer between 1 and r1+r2, and
 in that case tests whether al is locally ramified at the place pl instead.
Doc: Given a central simple algebra \var{al} output by \tet{alginit}, tests
 whether \var{al} is ramified, i.e. not isomorphic to a matrix algebra over its
 center. If \var{pl} is set, it should be a prime ideal of~$K$ or an integer
 between~$1$ and~$r_1+r_2$, and in that case tests whether \var{al} is locally
 ramified at the place \var{pl} instead.
