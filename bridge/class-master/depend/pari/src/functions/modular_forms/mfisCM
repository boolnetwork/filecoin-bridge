Prototype: G
Help: mfisCM(F): Tests whether the eigenform F is a CM form. The answer
 is 0 if it is not, and if it is, either the unique negative discriminant
 of the CM field, or the pair of two negative discriminants of CM fields,
 this latter case occuring only in weight 1 when the projective image is
 D2=C2xC2, i.e., coded 4 by mfgaloistype.
