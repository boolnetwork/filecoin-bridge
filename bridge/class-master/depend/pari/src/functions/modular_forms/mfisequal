Function: mfisequal
Section: modular_forms
C-Name: mfisequal
Prototype: lGGD0,L,
Help: mfisequal(F,G,{lim=0}): Checks whether the modular forms F and G
 are equal. If lim is nonzero, only check equality of the first lim+1 Fourier
 coefficients.
Doc:  Checks whether the modular forms $F$ and $G$ are equal. If \kbd{lim}
 is nonzero, only check equality of the first $lim+1$ Fourier coefficients
 and the function then also applies to generalized modular forms.
