Function: mfcoef
Section: modular_forms
C-Name: mfcoef
Prototype: GL
Help: mfcoef(F,n): Compute the n-th Fourier coefficient a(n) of the
 modular form F.
Doc: Compute the $n$-th Fourier coefficient of the generalized modular form $F$.
 Note that this is the $n+1$-st component of the vector
 \kbd{mfcoefs(F,n)} as well as the second component of \kbd{mfcoefs(F,1,n)}.
