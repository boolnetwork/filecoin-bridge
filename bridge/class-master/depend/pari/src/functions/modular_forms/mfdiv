Help: mfdiv(F,G): compute F/G for two modular forms F and G assuming
 that the quotient will not have poles at infinity. If this is the
 case, use mfshift before doing the division.
Doc: Given two generalized modular forms $F$ and $G$, compute $F/G$ assuming
 that the quotient will not have poles at infinity. If this is the
 case, use \kbd{mfshift} before doing the division.
