Help: plot(X=a,b,expr,{Ymin},{Ymax}): crude plot of expression expr, X goes
 from a to b, with Y ranging from Ymin to Ymax. If Ymin (resp. Ymax) is not
 given, the minimum (resp. the maximum) of the expression is used instead.
Doc: crude ASCII plot of the function represented by expression \var{expr}
 from $a$ to $b$, with \var{Y} ranging from \var{Ymin} to \var{Ymax}. If
 \var{Ymin} (resp. \var{Ymax}) is not given, the minimum (resp. the maximum)
 of the computed values of the expression is used instead.
