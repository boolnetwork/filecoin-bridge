Function: plothraw
Section: graphic
C-Name: plothraw
Prototype: GGD0,L,
Help: plothraw(X,Y,{flag=0}): plot in high resolution points whose x
 (resp. y) coordinates are in X (resp. Y). If flag is 1, join points,
 other non-0 flags should be combinations of bits 8,16,32,64,128,256 meaning
 the same as for ploth().
Doc: given $X$ and $Y$ two vectors of equal length, plots (in
 high precision) the points whose $(x,y)$-coordinates are given in
 $X$ and $Y$. Automatic positioning and scaling is done, but
 with the same scaling factor on $x$ and $y$. If $\fl$ is 1, join points,
 other non-0 flags toggle display options and should be combinations of bits
 $2^k$, $k \geq 3$ as in \kbd{ploth}.
