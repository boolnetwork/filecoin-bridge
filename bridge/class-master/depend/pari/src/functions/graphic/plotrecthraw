Prototype: LGD0,L,
Help: plotrecthraw(w,data,{flags=0}): plot graph(s) for data in rectwindow
 w, where data is a vector of vectors. If plot is parametric, length of data
 should be even, and pairs of entries give curves to plot. If not, first
 entry gives x-coordinate, and the other ones y-coordinates. Admits the same
 optional flags as plotrecth, save that recursive plot is meaningless.
Doc: plot graph(s) for
 \var{data} in rectwindow $w$. $\fl$ has the same significance here as in
 \kbd{ploth}, though recursive plot is no more significant.

 \var{data} is a vector of vectors, each corresponding to a list a coordinates.
 If parametric plot is set, there must be an even number of vectors, each
 successive pair corresponding to a curve. Otherwise, the first one contains
 the $x$ coordinates, and the other ones contain the $y$-coordinates
 of curves to plot.
