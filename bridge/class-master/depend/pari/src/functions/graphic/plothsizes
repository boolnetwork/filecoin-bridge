Function: plothsizes
Section: graphic
C-Name: plothsizes
Prototype: D0,L,
Help: plothsizes({flag=0}): returns array of 8 elements: terminal width and
 height, sizes for ticks in horizontal and vertical directions, width and
 height of characters, width and height of display (if applicable). If flag=0,
 sizes of ticks and characters are in pixels, otherwise are fractions of the
 terminal size.
Doc: return data corresponding to the output window
 in the form of a 8-component vector: window width and height, sizes for ticks
 in horizontal and vertical directions (this is intended for the \kbd{gnuplot}
 interface and is currently not significant), width and height of characters,
 width and height of display, if applicable. If display has no sense, e.g.
 for svg plots or postscript plots, then width and height of display are set
 to 0.

 If $\fl = 0$, sizes of ticks and characters are in
 pixels, otherwise are fractions of the screen size
