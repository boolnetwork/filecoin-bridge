Function: plotclip
Section: graphic
C-Name: plotclip
Prototype: vL
Help: plotclip(w): clip the contents of the rectwindow to the bounding box
 (except strings).
Doc: `clips' the content of rectwindow $w$, i.e remove all parts of the
 drawing that would not be visible on the screen. Together with
 \tet{plotcopy} this function enables you to draw on a scratchpad before
 committing the part you're interested in to the final picture.
