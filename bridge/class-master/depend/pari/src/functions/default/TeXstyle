Doc: the bits of this default allow
 \kbd{gp} to use less rigid TeX formatting commands in the logfile. This
 default is only taken into account when $\kbd{log} = 3$. The bits of
 \kbd{TeXstyle} have the following meaning

 2: insert \kbd{\bs right} / \kbd{\bs left} pairs where appropriate.

 4: insert discretionary breaks in polynomials, to enhance the probability of
 a good line break.

 The default value is \kbd{0}.
