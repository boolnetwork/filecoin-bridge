Doc: if set to a positive value, \kbd{gp} prints at
 most that many lines from each result, terminating the last line shown with
 \kbd{[+++]} if further material has been suppressed. The various \kbd{print}
 commands (see \secref{se:gp_program}) are unaffected, so you can always type
 \kbd{print(\%)} or \b{a} to view the full result. If the actual screen width
 cannot be determined, a ``line'' is assumed to be 80 characters long.

 The default value is \kbd{0}.
