Doc: this default can be 0 (off), 1 (on) or 2 (on, raw). When \kbd{echo}
 mode is on, each command is reprinted before being executed. This can be
 useful when reading a file with the \b{r} or \kbd{read} commands. For
 example, it is turned on at the beginning of the test files used to check
 whether \kbd{gp} has been built correctly (see \b{e}). When \kbd{echo} is set
 to 1 the input is cleaned up, removing white space and comments and uniting
 multi-line input. When set to 2 (raw), the input is written as-is, without any
 pre-processing.

 The default value is \kbd{0} (no echo).
