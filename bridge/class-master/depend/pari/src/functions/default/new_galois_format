Help:
Doc: this toggle is either 1 (on) or 0 (off). If on,
 the \tet{polgalois} command will use a different, more
 consistent, naming scheme for Galois groups. This default is provided to
 ensure that scripts can control this behavior and do not break unexpectedly.

 The default value is \kbd{0}. This value will change to $1$ (set) in the next
 major version.
