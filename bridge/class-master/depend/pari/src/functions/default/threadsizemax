Doc: This default is specific to the \emph{parallel} version of PARI and gp
 (built via \kbd{Configure --mt=pthread} or \kbd{mpi}) and is ignored
 otherwise. In parallel mode,
 each threads allocates its own private \tev{stack} for
 its computations, see \kbd{parisize} and \kbd{parisizemax}. The
 values of \kbd{threadsize} and \kbd{threadsizemax} determine the usual
 and maximal size in bytes of the stacks of each thread, so the total memory
 allocated will
 be between $\kbd{parisize}+\kbd{nbthreads}\times\kbd{threadsize}$. and
 $\kbd{parisizemax}+\kbd{nbthreads}\times\kbd{threadsizemax}$.

 If set to $0$, the value used is the same as \kbd{threadsize}. We strongy
 recommend to set both \kbd{parisizemax} and \kbd{threadsizemax} to a
 non-zero value.

 The default value is $0$.
