Doc: This default is specific to the \emph{parallel} version of PARI and gp
 (built via \kbd{Configure --mt=prthread} or \kbd{mpi}) and is ignored
 otherwise. In parallel mode, it governs the number of threads to use for
 parallel computing. The exact meaning and default value depend on the
 \kbd{mt} engine used:

 \item \kbd{single}: not used (always a single thread).

 \item \kbd{pthread}: number of threads (unlimited, default: number of cores)

 \item \kbd{mpi}: number of MPI processes to use (limited to the number
 allocated by \kbd{mpirun}, default: use all allocated processes).

 See also \kbd{threadsize} and \kbd{threadsizemax}.
