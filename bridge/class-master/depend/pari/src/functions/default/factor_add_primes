Help:
Doc: this toggle is either 1 (on) or 0 (off). If on,
 the integer factorization machinery calls \tet{addprimes} on prime
 factors that were difficult to find (larger than $2^{24}$), so they are
 automatically tried first in other factorizations. If a routine is performing
 (or has performed) a factorization and is interrupted by an error or via
 Control-C, this lets you recover the prime factors already found. The
 downside is that a huge \kbd{addprimes} table unrelated to the current
 computations will slow down arithmetic functions relying on integer
 factorization; one should then empty the table using \tet{removeprimes}.

 The default value is \kbd{0}.
