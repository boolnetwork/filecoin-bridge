Doc: this is a list of directories, separated by colons ':'
 (semicolons ';' in the DOS world, since colons are preempted for drive names).
 When asked to read a file whose name is not given by an absolute path
 (does not start with \kbd{/}, \kbd{./} or \kbd{../}), \kbd{gp} will look for
 it in these directories, in the order they were written in \kbd{path}. Here,
 as usual, \kbd{.} means the current directory, and \kbd{..} its immediate
 parent. Environment expansion is performed.

 The default value is \kbd{".:\til:\til/gp"} on UNIX systems,
 \kbd{".;C:\bs;C:\bs GP"} on DOS, OS/2 and Windows, and \kbd{"."} otherwise.
