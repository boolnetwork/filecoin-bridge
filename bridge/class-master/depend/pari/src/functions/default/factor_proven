Doc: this toggle is either 1 (on) or 0 (off). By
 default, the factors output by the integer factorization machinery are
 only pseudo-primes, not proven primes. If this toggle is
 set, a primality proof is done for each factor and all results depending on
 integer factorization are fully proven. This flag does not affect partial
 factorization when it is explicitly requested. It also does not affect the
 private table managed by \tet{addprimes}: its entries are included as is in
 factorizations, without being tested for primality.

 The default value is \kbd{0}.
