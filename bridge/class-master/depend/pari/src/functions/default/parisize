Doc: \kbd{gp}, and in fact any program using the PARI
 library, needs a \tev{stack} in which to do its computations; \kbd{parisize}
 is the stack size, in bytes. It is recommended to increase this
 default using a \tet{gprc}, to the value you believe PARI should be happy
 with, given your typical computation. We strongly recommend to also
 set \tet{parisizemax} to a much larger value in your \kbd{gprc}, about what
 you believe your machine can stand: PARI will then try to fit its
 computations within about \kbd{parisize} bytes, but will increase the stack
 size if needed (up to \kbd{parisizemax}). Once the memory intensive
 computation is over, PARI will restore the stack size to the originally
 requested \kbd{parisize}.

 The default value is 4M, resp.~8M on a 32-bit, resp.~64-bit machine.
