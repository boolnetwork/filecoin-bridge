Help:
Doc: \kbd{gp} keeps a history of the last
 \kbd{histsize} results computed so far, which you can recover using the
 \kbd{\%} notation (see \secref{se:history}). When this number is exceeded,
 the oldest values are erased. Tampering with this default is the only way to
 get rid of the ones you do not need anymore.

 The default value is \kbd{5000}.
