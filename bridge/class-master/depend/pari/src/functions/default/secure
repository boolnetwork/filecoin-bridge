Help:
Doc: this toggle is either 1 (on) or 0 (off). If on, the \tet{system} and
 \tet{extern} command are disabled. These two commands are potentially
 dangerous when you execute foreign scripts since they let \kbd{gp} execute
 arbitrary UNIX commands. \kbd{gp} will ask for confirmation before letting
 you (or a script) unset this toggle.

 The default value is \kbd{0}.
