Doc: this toggle is either 1 (on) or 0 (off). When the PARI library computes
 something, the type of the
 result is not always the simplest possible. The only type conversions which
 the PARI library does automatically are rational numbers to integers (when
 they are of type \typ{FRAC} and equal to integers), and similarly rational
 functions to polynomials (when they are of type \typ{RFRAC} and equal to
 polynomials). This feature is useful in many cases, and saves time, but can
 be annoying at times. Hence you can disable this and, whenever you feel like
 it, use the function \kbd{simplify} (see Chapter 3) which allows you to
 simplify objects to the simplest possible types recursively (see~\b{y}).
 \sidx{automatic simplification}

 The default value is \kbd{1}.
