Doc: \kbd{gp}, and in fact any program using the PARI library, needs a
 \tev{stack} in which to do its computations.  If non-zero,  \tet{parisizemax}
 is the maximum size the stack can grow to, in bytes.  If zero, the stack will
 not automatically grow, and will be limited to the value of \kbd{parisize}.

 When \kbd{parisizemax} is set, PARI tries to fit its
 computations within about \kbd{parisize} bytes, but will increase the stack
 size if needed, roughly doubling it each time (up to \kbd{parisizemax}
 of course!) and printing a message such as \kbd{Warning: increasing stack size to}
 \var{some value}. Once the memory intensive computation is over, PARI
 will restore the stack size to the originally requested \kbd{parisize}
 without printing further messages.

 We \emph{strongly} recommend to set \tet{parisizemax} permanently to a large
 non-zero value in your \tet{gprc}, about what you believe your machine can
 stand. It is possible to increase or decrease \kbd{parisizemax} inside a
 running \kbd{gp} session, just use \kbd{default} as usual.

 The default value is $0$, for backward compatibility reasons.
