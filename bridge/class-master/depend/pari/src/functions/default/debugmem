Doc: memory debugging level (see \b{gm}). If this is non-zero, \kbd{gp} will
 print increasingly precise notifications about memory use:

 \item $\kbd{debugmem} > 0$, notify when \kbd{parisize} changes (within the
 boundaries set by \kbd{parisizemax});

 \item $\kbd{debugmem} > 1$, indicate any important garbage collection and the
 function it is taking place in;

 \item $\kbd{debugmem} > 2$, indicate the creation/destruction of
 ``blocks'' (or clones); expect lots of messages.

 \noindent {\bf Important Note:}
 if you are running a version compiled for debugging (see Appendix~A) and
 $\kbd{debugmem} > 1$, \kbd{gp} will further regularly print information on
 memory usage, notifying whenever stack usage goes up or down by 1 MByte.
 This functionality is disabled on non-debugging builds as it noticeably
 slows down the performance.

 The default value is \kbd{1}.
