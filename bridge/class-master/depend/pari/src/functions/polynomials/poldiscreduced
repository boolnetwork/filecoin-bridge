Help: poldiscreduced(f): vector of elementary divisors of Z[a]/f'(a)Z[a],
 where a is a root of the polynomial f.
Doc: reduced discriminant vector of the
 (integral, monic) polynomial $f$. This is the vector of elementary divisors
 of $\Z[\alpha]/f'(\alpha)\Z[\alpha]$, where $\alpha$ is a root of the
 polynomial $f$. The components of the result are all positive, and their
 product is equal to the absolute value of the discriminant of~$f$.
