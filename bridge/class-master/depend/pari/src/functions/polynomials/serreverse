Function: serreverse
Section: polynomials
C-Name: serreverse
Prototype: G
Help: serreverse(s): reversion of the power series s.
Doc: reverse power series of $s$, i.e. the series $t$ such that $t(s) = x$;
 $s$ must be a power series whose valuation is exactly equal to one.

 ? t = serreverse(tan(x))
 %2 = x - 1/3*x^3 + 1/5*x^5 - 1/7*x^7 + O(x^8)
 ? tan(t)
 %3 = x + O(x^8)
