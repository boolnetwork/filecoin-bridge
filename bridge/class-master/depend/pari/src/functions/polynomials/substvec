Function: substvec
Section: polynomials
C-Name: gsubstvec
Prototype: GGG
Help: substvec(x,v,w): in expression x, make a best effort to replace the
 variables v1,...,vn by the expression w1,...,wn.
Doc: $v$ being a vector of monomials of degree 1 (variables),
 $w$ a vector of expressions of the same length, replace in the expression
 $x$ all occurrences of $v_i$ by $w_i$. The substitutions are done
 simultaneously; more precisely, the $v_i$ are first replaced by new
 variables in $x$, then these are replaced by the $w_i$:

 \bprog
 ? substvec([x,y], [x,y], [y,x])
 %1 = [y, x]
 ? substvec([x,y], [x,y], [y,x+y])
 %2 = [y, x + y]     \\ not [y, 2*y]
