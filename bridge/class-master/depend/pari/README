This is PARI/GP, version 2.11.x (*).

PARI/GP Number Theory-oriented Computer Algebra System
        Copyright (C) 2000-2018 The PARI Group, Bordeaux.

==========================================================================

To get started, run

  cd doc; tex INSTALL.tex

and have a look at the file INSTALL.dvi, extracted verbatim from Appendix A
of the User Manual. (Or pdftex INSTALL.tex if PDF files are more convenient.)
If you are in a hurry, look at the ASCII file 'INSTALL' but a lot of
information is missing there.

Once 'Configure' has been run, 'make doc' typesets separate user's manual for
GP and libpari, a tutorial and reference card in directory doc.

The file NEW contains new features with respect to previous stable versions.
The file COMPAT warns about incompatible changes. See the files
CHANGES* for a terse description of successive patches.

For the adventurous: to check out bleeding-edge development versions of
PARI/GP, see the file README-git.

Afterwards, you're on your own.

==========================================================================

There are three mailing lists devoted to the PARI/GP package, and most
feedback should be directed to those. They are:

* pari-announce: to announce major version changes. You can't write to this
one, but you should probably subscribe.

* pari-dev: for everything related to the development of PARI, including
suggestions, technical questions, bug reports or patch submissions.

* pari-users: for everything else.

To subscribe, send empty messages respectively to

   pari-announce-request@pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr
   pari-users-request@pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr
   pari-dev-request@pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr

with a Subject: containing the word "subscribe".

If you are not a member of any of those lists and do not want to become
one, you can write to us at

  pari@math.u-bordeaux.fr

We may forward your mail to the lists above and will definitely try to
correct faulty behaviour, if necessary. But we cannot promise that you
will get an individual answer.

Last but not least, PARI home page can be found at

  http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/

  Thanks for your support, and have fun !

(*) Version numbers have the shape: MAJOR.MINOR.patchlevel.status. The status
increases through {alpha, beta, release}. New features are introduced during
the `alpha' phase, tested during `beta', and declared stable when `release'
is reached.
The MAJOR version number will not change for a while.
The MINOR version number increases by 2 when a new status cycle starts (as
soon as a 'release' version is out): odd numbers are reserved for 'released'
versions, even ones for alpha/beta phase.
The patchlevel goes up each time we feel an upgrade is necessary (improvement
or bugfix). 'Release' versions may be updated with further patchlevels if
important bugs need to be fixed before the next cycle reaches completion.
